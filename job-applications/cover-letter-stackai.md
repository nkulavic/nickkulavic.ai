Dear StackAI Team,

I'm applying for the Staff Backend Engineer position. With a decade of experience building enterprise backend systems and a track record of scaling AI-powered SaaS platforms, I'm excited about contributing to StackAI's enterprise AI transformation mission.

## Backend Engineering at Scale

**Production Infrastructure**
- Architected AWS serverless systems using 12+ services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, Cognito, SES, SNS, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Built REST APIs handling 2M+ monthly requests with 99.9% uptime
- Designed Go & Node.js Lambda microservices with delta sync optimization

**Enterprise-Ready Systems**
- Maintained SOC 2 compliant development workflows
- Implemented AES-256 encryption at rest and in transit
- Built multi-region storage redundancy and point-in-time recovery
- Zero security breaches across all platforms

**Integration Expertise**
At ListBackup.ai and MyFusion Solutions, I've built 50+ integrations with enterprise platforms including Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, Shopify, and more. I understand the complexity of enterprise data flows and the importance of reliability.

## Why StackAI

Enterprise AI transformation requires rock-solid backend infrastructure. I bring the experience of building systems that enterprises depend on—systems that must be reliable, secure, and scalable. My SaaS founder experience also means I understand the full product lifecycle, not just the technical implementation.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to StackAI's mission.

Best regards,
