Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Applied AI Engineer position. As someone who uses Claude extensively in production systems—building AI-powered document processing, natural language querying, and intelligent automation—I'm deeply invested in the success of the Claude platform and would be honored to contribute to its development.

## My Experience with Claude in Production

At Take3Tech, I've integrated Claude (via AWS Bedrock) into enterprise mortgage technology:
- Built AI-powered querying systems that let users ask questions about complex lending guidelines in natural language
- Achieved 80% faster document processing through intelligent PDF analysis
- Designed multi-model architectures that leverage Claude's strengths alongside Gemini and Groq

I use Claude Code daily for development, and my portfolio site (nickkulavic.ai) features a Claude-powered chat assistant that answers questions about my work.

## Engineering Background

While my primary experience is in full-stack and platform engineering rather than ML research, I bring:
- 10+ years production systems experience (Go, Node.js, TypeScript, AWS)
- Proven ability to build reliable, scalable infrastructure (99.9% uptime, zero security breaches)
- Deep understanding of how developers integrate AI into real applications
- SaaS founder perspective ($1.7M+ revenue, 2,000+ users)

## Why Anthropic

I'm drawn to Anthropic's mission of building reliable, interpretable AI systems. Having built production systems that depend on Claude's capabilities, I have a vested interest in seeing the technology succeed and would bring a practitioner's perspective to improving the platform.

I'm open to the Bay Area hybrid arrangement and would be excited to contribute to making Claude even more useful for developers building real-world applications.

Best regards,
Nick Kulavic
