Dear Abacus.AI Team,

I'm excited to apply for an engineering role at Abacus.AI. Your focus on end-to-end ownership across ML prompting, distributed systems, and user-facing features perfectly matches how I work—I've spent 10+ years building full-stack systems with recent deep focus on AI integration.

- Infrastructure: 12+ AWS services, CI/CD, monitoring

**Advanced ML/AI Implementation**
- Built AI-powered document processing achieving 80% faster performance
- Designed prompt engineering systems for complex domain queries (mortgage guidelines)

- Created natural language interfaces for querying structured data

**Distributed Systems**

## Why Abacus.AI

I'm drawn to companies pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. My experience building production AI systems—not just experiments, but platforms that serve thousands of users—positions me to contribute immediately to Abacus.AI's mission.

Looking forward to discussing how my full-stack AI experience can contribute to your team.
