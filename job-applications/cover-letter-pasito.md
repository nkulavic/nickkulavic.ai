Dear Pasito Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Full Stack Engineer role. With extensive experience building AI-powered full-stack applications and a background in user-facing SaaS products, I'm well-positioned to contribute to your AI agent development for insurance and benefits.

## Full Stack + AI Experience

**End-to-End AI Applications**
- Built AI-powered portfolio site (Next.js + Gemini) with conversational assistant
- Developed RuleTool: SvelteKit frontend + Claude AI backend for natural language queries
- Created user-facing dashboards for AI-driven data insights at ListBackup.ai

**Production Full Stack**
- Frontend: React, Next.js, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Go, AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB
- Real-time features: WebSockets, webhooks, event-driven architecture

**Complex Domain Experience**
At Take3Tech, I work on mortgage lending software—a complex, regulated domain similar to insurance. I understand the importance of accuracy, compliance, and making complex information accessible through intuitive interfaces.

## What I Bring

- 10+ years full-stack development with modern JavaScript/TypeScript
- Production AI integration (Claude, Gemini, AWS Bedrock)
- SaaS founder mindset—I think about users, not just code
- Experience building for complex regulated industries

I'm drawn to Pasito's mission of making insurance and benefits more accessible. Looking forward to discussing how I can contribute.

Best regards,
