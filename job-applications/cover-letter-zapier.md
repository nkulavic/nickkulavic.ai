I'm excited to apply for an engineering role at Zapier. With 10+ years building integration platforms—including 60+ connectors serving 2,000+ users processing 2M+ monthly requests—I've essentially built a Zapier competitor from scratch. I understand this space deeply.

## Why Zapier

I've spent years building what Zapier does—connecting platforms and enabling automation for non-technical users. I understand the challenges: auth flows, rate limits, schema changes, error handling, and making complex workflows feel simple.

I'd love to bring my integration expertise to the team that sets the standard for workflow automation.
