Dear Hightouch Team,

I'm thrilled to apply for a Software Engineer role at Hightouch. Your positioning at the intersection of LLMs/agentic AI and cloud data warehouses perfectly matches my experience—I've spent years building integration platforms and more recently, AI-powered systems.

## Why I'm a Perfect Fit

**Integration Platform Expertise**
At MyFusion Solutions, I built exactly what Hightouch enables:
- 60+ helper integrations connecting CRM data to business tools
- Real-time data synchronization across 30+ platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, etc.)
- 2M+ monthly API requests with webhook-based event processing
- Custom workflow builder for non-technical users

**AI Agent Development**
Recent work has focused on intelligent automation:
- Built AI agents that query complex documents using natural language (RuleTool)
- Implemented AI-powered data mapping and anomaly detection (ListBackup.ai)
- Integrated Claude, Gemini, and AWS Bedrock for production use cases

**Data Warehouse & Integration**
- Google Sheets API integration as flagship product ("Google Sheet It")
- Experience syncing CRM data with automated refresh and scheduling
- Built data pipelines connecting disparate business systems

## Technical Match

- **Languages:** Node.js, TypeScript, Go, Python
- **Infrastructure:** AWS Lambda, serverless architecture, webhooks
- **Integrations:** 50+ platform APIs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, Shopify, Twilio, etc.)
- **AI/ML:** AWS Bedrock, Claude, prompt engineering, agentic systems

I've built integration and data activation platforms from scratch—I understand the challenges and opportunities in this space deeply.
