Dear Skylight Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Full Stack Software Engineer role focused on AI features. The opportunity to work directly with leadership to build new AI-powered features—combining product thinking with technical execution—is exactly where I excel.

## Building AI Features from Scratch

**RuleTool - AI Query System**
At Take3Tech, I built an AI feature that:
- Enables natural language queries against complex mortgage guidelines
- Processes PDF documents through AWS Bedrock/Claude for intelligent extraction
- Achieved 80% faster processing times
- Provides conversational interface for non-technical users

**ListBackup.ai - AI-Powered Intelligence**
Built AI features including:
- Intelligent data mapping across 50+ platforms
- Predictive analytics for data synchronization
- Smart anomaly detection and alerting
- AI-driven recommendations for data management

**Portfolio AI Chat**
My personal site features an AI assistant (Gemini) that answers questions about my work—demonstrating end-to-end AI feature development.

## Full-Stack Depth

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Go, AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB
- **AI:** AWS Bedrock, Claude, Gemini, prompt engineering
- **Shipping:** CI/CD, automated deployments, production monitoring

## Product + Engineering

As a SaaS founder ($1.7M+ revenue, 2,000+ users), I don't just build features—I think about user problems, iterate based on feedback, and ship products that people actually use.

Excited to bring this combination of AI expertise and product thinking to Skylight.
