Dear Airtable Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role on the Observability team, specifically focused on LLM observability for AI-powered features. My experience building and monitoring production AI systems directly aligns with providing visibility into prompts, model calls, and RAG performance.

## LLM Production Experience

**Multi-Model AI Systems**
I've integrated and monitored multiple LLMs in production:
- AWS Bedrock + Claude for document processing
- Gemini for conversational AI features
- Groq for fast inference use cases
- Experience with prompt engineering, context management, and model selection

**Observability in Practice**
Building reliable AI features requires monitoring:
- Latency tracking across model calls and processing pipelines
- Cost monitoring for API usage across models
- Quality evaluation of AI outputs
- Safety signals and content filtering

## Infrastructure & Monitoring Background

- **Production systems:** 2M+ monthly requests, 99.9% uptime
- **AWS CloudWatch:** Comprehensive metrics and logging
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with deployment monitoring
- **Error handling:** Designed fault-tolerant systems with graceful degradation

## Why This Role

I've experienced firsthand the challenge of understanding what's happening inside AI-powered features. When an LLM feature isn't performing as expected, visibility into prompts, responses, latency, and costs is essential. I want to help build the observability tools that make AI features reliable and debuggable.

Looking forward to discussing how my production AI experience can contribute to Airtable's observability efforts.

Best regards,
