Dear Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Principal AI Engineer role at Apollo.io. With 10+ years building production systems and deep hands-on experience with AWS Bedrock, Claude, and multi-model AI architectures, I'm excited about the opportunity to lead AI innovation at scale.

## Why I'm a Strong Fit

**Production AI Systems at Scale**
At Take3Tech, I architect AI-powered document processing pipelines using AWS Bedrock and Claude, achieving 80% faster processing times for mortgage document analysis. I've integrated multiple AI models (Groq, Gemini, Claude) for intelligent querying of complex lending guidelines in natural language.

**Enterprise SaaS Leadership**
As founder of ListBackup.ai and MyFusion Solutions, I've built profitable SaaS platforms generating $1.7M+ in cumulative revenue. My flagship product processes 2M+ monthly API requests with 99.9% uptime, serving 2,000+ active users across six continents.

**Technical Depth + Business Acumen**
I bring the rare combination of hands-on technical expertise (Go, Node.js, TypeScript, AWS serverless) with proven ability to build, scale, and monetize AI-powered products. I've maintained SOC 2 compliant development workflows with zero security breaches.

## Relevant Experience

- Architected multi-model AI integration (AWS Bedrock, Claude, Gemini, Groq) for production use
- Built 50+ platform integrations with enterprise-grade security (AES-256, multi-region storage)
- Led full-stack development on enterprise systems serving 500+ loan officers
- Designed serverless architectures using 12+ AWS services

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building and scaling AI-powered enterprise platforms aligns with Apollo.io's vision.
