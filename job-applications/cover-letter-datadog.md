Dear Datadog Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer role on the Data & Analytics Platform team. With 10+ years building distributed systems and data pipelines at scale, I'm drawn to the challenge of processing millions of data points per second while enabling teams across Datadog to derive value from data.

## Distributed Systems Experience

**High-Volume Data Processing**
At MyFusion Solutions, I built systems that:
- Process 2M+ monthly API requests with 99.9% uptime
- Handle real-time webhook processing across 30+ platform integrations
- Sync data across six continents via AWS Lambda

**Streaming & Event-Driven Architecture**
- Built real-time data synchronization systems using webhooks and event streaming
- Designed delta sync optimization and conflict resolution for ListBackup.ai
- Implemented WebSocket architecture for real-time collaboration features

**Production Infrastructure**
- Architected AWS serverless systems using Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SNS, CloudWatch
- Maintained SOC 2 compliant workflows with comprehensive monitoring
- Built infrastructure handling enterprise-scale data flows

## Data Platform Experience

**ListBackup.ai**
Built an AI-powered data backup platform that:
- Connects to 50+ business tools with intelligent data mapping
- Implements predictive analytics and smart anomaly detection
- Provides point-in-time recovery with version control and audit trails

**Analytics & Observability**
- Experience with CloudWatch for production monitoring
- Built data pipelines using AWS Athena and Glue
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging across platforms

I'm excited about contributing to infrastructure that powers data-driven decisions at Datadog scale.
