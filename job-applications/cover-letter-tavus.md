Dear Tavus Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Software Engineer role focused on Agentic Systems. My experience building AI-powered automation platforms—where AI agents orchestrate complex workflows across 50+ integrations—directly aligns with what you're building.

## Agentic AI Experience

**RuleTool - AI Query Agent**
At Take3Tech, I built an AI system that acts as an intelligent agent for mortgage lending guidelines. Users ask natural language questions, and the system queries processed PDF documents using Claude/Gemini to return accurate answers. This required designing prompt architectures, managing context windows, and building reliable agent behaviors.

**ListBackup.ai - Intelligent Automation**
My SaaS platform uses AI for intelligent data mapping, predictive analytics, and smart anomaly detection across 50+ business tool integrations. The system makes autonomous decisions about data synchronization, conflict resolution, and alerting.

**MyFusion Helper - Workflow Orchestration**
I built a workflow automation platform where agents process webhooks, make decisions based on business rules, and execute multi-step actions across CRM, payment, and communication platforms—processing 2M+ monthly requests.

## Technical Foundation

- Go & Node.js microservices with AWS Lambda
- Real-time systems (WebSockets, webhooks, event-driven architecture)
- Production AI integration (AWS Bedrock, Claude, Gemini, Groq)
- Enterprise security (SOC 2, zero breaches)

I'm passionate about building AI systems that reliably accomplish tasks in the real world. Would love to discuss how my experience building production agentic systems can contribute to Tavus.
