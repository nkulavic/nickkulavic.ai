Dear Vercel Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer role on the Vercel Marketplace team. As someone who deploys production Next.js applications on Vercel daily and has built 50+ third-party integrations, this role perfectly combines my expertise.

## Vercel & Next.js Experience

**Portfolio Site (nickkulavic.ai)**
- Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- Deployed on Vercel with automatic CI/CD
- Features AI chat integration with Gemini
- Uses Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights

**Production Deployments**
- Multiple Next.js applications deployed on Vercel
- Experience with edge functions, serverless, and static generation
- Deep understanding of the Vercel developer experience

## Integration & Marketplace Expertise

At MyFusion Solutions and ListBackup.ai, I've built exactly what Vercel Marketplace enables:
- **50+ platform integrations** (Stripe, Supabase, Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- **OAuth and API connectivity** at scale
- **Unified billing and provisioning** experiences
- **Developer-focused UX** for integration management

I understand the challenges of building frictionless integration workflows—I've solved them for 2,000+ users processing 2M+ monthly API requests.

## Technical Fit

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, AWS Lambda, serverless architecture
- **Integrations:** REST APIs, webhooks, OAuth, third-party platforms
- **Infrastructure:** CI/CD, automated deployments, monitoring

I'd love to contribute to making Vercel Marketplace the best place for developers to discover and integrate tools.
