Dear Retool Team,

I'm excited to apply for an engineering role at Retool. With 10+ years building internal tools and automation platforms—serving 2,000+ users who rely on my tools for their daily operations—I deeply understand the space Retool dominates.

## Internal Tools Experience

**MyFusion Helper - Internal Operations Platform**
I built exactly what Retool enables teams to create:
- 60+ helper tools extending CRM functionality
- Custom workflow builder for non-technical users
- Connected databases, APIs, and third-party services
- Real-time data synchronization and webhook processing

**Why This Matters:**
My users are small business operators who need to build automations without writing code. I've spent years making complex integrations feel simple—the same challenge Retool solves at scale.

## AI Integration Experience

With Retool's focus on AI (app generation, AI Agents, AI Actions), my recent work is directly relevant:
- Integrated Claude, Gemini, and AWS Bedrock into production tools
- Built AI-powered document processing and querying systems
- Designed natural language interfaces for complex operations
- Experience with prompt engineering and LLM orchestration

## Technical Foundation

- **Full-stack:** React, Node.js, TypeScript—the same stack Retool uses
- **Databases:** DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **APIs:** Built and consumed hundreds of REST APIs
- **Infrastructure:** AWS serverless, CI/CD, production monitoring

I've built internal tools platforms from scratch. I'd love to help make Retool even better for the millions of teams who rely on it.

Best regards,
