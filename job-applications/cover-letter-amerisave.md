Dear AmeriSave Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Director of AI & Intelligent Document Processing role. This position is a perfect match for my experience—I currently lead AI document processing development for mortgage technology at Take3Tech, and have built the exact systems this role oversees.

## Direct Experience Match

**Mortgage AI Document Processing (Current Role)**
At Take3Tech, I architect AI-powered document processing pipelines for enterprise mortgage software:
- Built AI systems using AWS Bedrock and Claude to process mortgage investor guidelines and agency requirements
- Achieved 80% faster processing times through intelligent PDF parsing and data extraction
- Developed natural language querying system allowing users to ask questions about complex lending guidelines
- Maintained SOC 2 compliant workflows with zero security breaches

**Enterprise Mortgage Platform**
I architect and maintain LoanMaps, a comprehensive .NET loan origination system serving 500+ loan officers, handling the entire mortgage process end-to-end. This gives me deep understanding of:
- Mortgage compliance frameworks (TRID, RESPA, HMDA)
- LOS systems and integrations
- The full loan lifecycle from application to closing

## Leadership & Strategy

Beyond technical implementation, I bring strategic perspective:
- 10+ years building and scaling production systems
- Founded multiple SaaS companies ($1.7M+ revenue)
- Experience mentoring engineers and leading technical design
- Track record of implementing AI at scale with measurable business impact

I'm ready to architect and scale intelligent document processing systems that transform mortgage operations.
