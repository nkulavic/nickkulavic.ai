Dear OpenAI Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for an engineering role at OpenAI. With 10+ years building production systems and recent deep experience integrating AI models into enterprise applications, I can bridge the gap between research capabilities and real-world deployment.

## Production AI Systems

I've built systems that depend on AI models working reliably at scale:

**RuleTool - Enterprise AI Application**
- Built AI-powered querying system using multiple LLMs for mortgage document analysis
- Designed prompt architectures for complex domain knowledge extraction
- Achieved 80% faster processing while maintaining accuracy
- Production system used by 500+ loan officers daily

**ListBackup.ai - AI-Powered Platform**
- Integrated AI for intelligent data mapping across 50+ platforms
- Built predictive analytics and anomaly detection systems
- Designed multi-model architectures (Claude, Gemini, AWS Bedrock)

## Engineering Foundation

My decade of production systems experience provides the foundation for AI engineering:
- **Scale:** 2M+ monthly API requests, 99.9% uptime
- **Reliability:** Zero security breaches, SOC 2 compliance
- **Full-stack:** Node.js, Go, TypeScript, React, AWS serverless
- **Infrastructure:** CI/CD, monitoring, automated deployments

## Why OpenAI

I'm drawn to working on the systems that make AI more useful and reliable for developers. My experience building applications that depend on AI—and understanding what works and what doesn't in production—positions me to contribute to making OpenAI's models more deployable.

Looking forward to discussing how my production AI experience can contribute.
