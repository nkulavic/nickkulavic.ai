Dear Stripe Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the AI Solutions Architect role. With deep experience integrating Stripe's payment systems into production SaaS platforms and a strong background in AI/ML implementation, I can bridge the gap between Stripe's AI capabilities and customer success.

## Stripe Integration Experience

I've built extensive Stripe integrations across my SaaS platforms:

**MyFusion Solutions ($1.7M+ Revenue)**
- Implemented Stripe for subscription billing and payment processing
- Built automated payment recovery and dunning management
- Processed transactions across six continents via AWS Lambda

**ListBackup.ai**
- Integrated Stripe across tiered pricing model (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- Built custom billing workflows for enterprise hierarchy systems

**ACEVA E-commerce**
- Implemented subscription billing with failed payment recovery
- Managed recurring auto-ship programs for nutraceutical products

## AI/ML Implementation

My AI experience directly translates to architecting solutions:
- Integrated AWS Bedrock, Claude, Gemini, and Groq into production systems
- Built AI-powered document processing achieving 80% faster performance
- Designed multi-model architectures for intelligent automation
- Experience with prompt engineering and production AI deployment

## Why This Role

As someone who has integrated Stripe payments AND implemented AI systems, I understand both sides of the AI Solutions Architect equation. I can speak the language of developers implementing Stripe while deeply understanding AI architecture patterns.

I'd welcome the opportunity to help Stripe customers unlock the power of AI in their payment workflows.

Best regards,
